		<p></p>
		<p>Certain areas of the Site and Application (and your access to or use of certain aspects of the Services or Collective Content) may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Application, Services, or Collective Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Application, Services, or Collective Content.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE, APPLICATION OR SERVICES OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON THE SITE, VIA THE APPLICATION OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE SITE AND APPLICATION. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, APPLICATION, SERVICES, OR COLLECTIVE CONTENT. If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, "you" and "your" will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Modification</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Chakula reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify the Site, Application or Services or to modify these Terms, including the Service Fees, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will either post the modification on the Site or via the Application or otherwise provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the "Last Updated Date" at the top of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Site, Application or Services after we have posted a modification on the Site or via the Application or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms.

		<p></p>
		<p>Eligibility</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>The Site, Application and Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or older. Any access to or use of the Site, Application or Services by anyone under 18 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Site, Application or Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>How the Site, Application and Services Work</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>The Site, Application and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and booking of culinary services ("Services"). Such Services are included in Listings on the Site, Application by Chefs. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site and Application; however, if you wish to book a Service or create a Listing, you must first register to create an Chakula Account (defined below).</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>As stated above, Chakula makes available an online platform or marketplace with related technology for Guests and Chefs to meet online and arrange for bookings of Services directly with each other. Chakula is not an owner or operator of cooking facilities, including, but not limited to, restaurants, cafes, or other food Services, nor is it a provider of properties, including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Services and Chakula does not own, sell, resell, provide, manage or control foodstuffs. Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the Chakula platform, Chakula's responsibilities are limited to: (i) facilitating the availability of the Site, Application and Services and (ii) serving as the limited payment collection agent of each Chef for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on behalf of the Chef.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE ChefS AND GUESTS CONNECTING AND BOOKING ServiceS DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. Chakula CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ServiceS. Chakula IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND ServiceS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS WILL BE MADE OR ACCEPTED AT THE MEMBER'S OWN RISK.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Account Registration</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>In order to access certain features of the Site and Application, and to book an Service or create a Listing, you must register to create an account ("Chakula Account") and become a Member. You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites ("SNS") (including, but not limited to, Facebook; each such account, a "Third-Party Account"), via our Site or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link your Chakula Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information to Chakula through the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing Chakula to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Chakula and/or grant Chakula access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Chakula to pay any fees or making Chakula subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Chakula access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Chakula will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account ("SNS Content") so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your Chakula Account and Chakula Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your Chakula Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Chakula's access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Chakula Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the "Settings" section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Chakula makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Chakula is not responsible for any SNS Content.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Your Chakula Account and your Chakula Account profile page will be created for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Chakula Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Chakula reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Chakula Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Chakula Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Chakula Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Chakula of any unauthorized use of your Chakula Account.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Service Listings</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Service to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, and availability of the Service and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all Services must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Service via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a booking of your Service, you may not request the Guest to pay a higher price than in the booking request.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Listings and Member Content you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest's stay at, an Service in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, lease or rental agreements, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws and laws governing rentals of residential and other properties), Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Service included in a Listing you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Chakula assumes no responsibility for a Chef's compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Chakula reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Chakula, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or Chakula's then-current Policies and Community Guidelines, or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>If you are a Chef, you understand and agree that Chakula does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Guest requests a booking of your Service and attends your event, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Chakula is not a party to it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Chakula serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Chef for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Chef, payments from Guests of such amounts stipulated by the Chef (including cleaning or other fees and/or Taxes).</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>If you are a Chef, Chakula makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm or preapprove for booking for your Service. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Chef, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Service at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Service, if applicable.)</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Chakula recommends that Chefs obtain appropriate insurance for their Services. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Service carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Service, if applicable) while at your Service.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Chakula may offer Chefs the option of having photographers take photographs of their Services. If you as a Chef choose to have a photographer do this, the photographs taken will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words "Chakula.com Verified Photo" or similar wording ("Verified Images"). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring that your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone are responsible for using the Verified Images and you warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other images if such images cease to accurately represent your Listing. All images, materials and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images, constitute Chakula Content, regardless of whether you include them in your Listing. You agree that Chakula may use the Verified Images for advertising, marketing, commercial and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>No Endorsement</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Chakula does not endorse any Member or any Service. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of the Service at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by Chakula of any Member or any Service. Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information, and although Chakula may undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of users, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member's purported identity or background.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being "verified" or "connected" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Chakula about any Member, including of the Member's identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay with a Chef or to accept a booking request from a Guest, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. Except as provided in the Chakula Chef Guarantee Terms and Conditions ("Chakula Chef Guarantee"), which is an agreement between Chakula and Chefs, we are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Chakula with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Chef against Chakula regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by Chakula on behalf of a Chef, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled "Limitation of Liability".</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Appointment of Chakula as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Chef</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Each Chef hereby appoints Chakula as the Chef's limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Accommodation Fees from Guests.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Each Chef agrees that payment made by a Guest through Chakula, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Chef, and the Chef will make the Accommodation available to the Guest in the agreed-upon manner as if the Chef has received the Service Fees. Each Chefs agrees that Chakula may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Chef and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund (via Chakula) to the Guest that portion of the Service Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Chef understands that as Chakula accepts payments from Guests as the Chef's limited payment collection agent and that Chakula' obligation to pay the Chef is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Guests. Chakula does not guarantee payments to Chefs for amounts that have not been successfully received by Chakula from Guests. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Chef, Chakula assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Chef.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Please note that Chakula does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you as a Chef acknowledge and agree that Chakula reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that Chakula will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Chefs are solely responsible for any and all national, regional, and municipal tax compliance. </p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Chakula Fees</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Each Chef allows Chakula to charge a fee on top of the Chef's asking price, to be paid by the customer. Chakula will not give a chef less than their asking price.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>External Contact with Guests</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Chakula explicitly prohibits Chefs from contacting Guests outside of the communication means provided by the Site, Application and Services related to any business that the chef could offer through the Site, Application and Services. Chakula reserves the right to ban any Chef from the Site, Application and Services in the case that they contacted Guests introduced to them via Chakula through any communication method, including but not limited to: SMS message, social networking services such as Facebook or Whatsapp, or email. </p>
